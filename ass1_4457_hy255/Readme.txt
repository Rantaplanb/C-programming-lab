My name is Loukas Mertzanis (4457) and this program is a translator,
from ISO8859-7 to ISO8859-1. 
I tried to follow the assignment instructions strictly.
The program not only works properly, but i have also paid
attention in its design and coding style, in order to be 
easily readable and understandable.
I could avoid using a global array, but in this case,
i would have to pass around memory addresses,
which would make the program more prone to buggs
and harder to read/understand.
This is just my 2nd semester in CSD,
so this exercice was not easy for me,
but i managed to complete it,
using the "bonus" feature too!
Very happy with the result, spent around 15 hours for it.
